imgur-python
============

A Python client for the Imgur API.

The original imgurpython project is no longer supported, so, I decided to create my own python client for the [Imgur API](https://apidocs.imgur.com/?version=latest).

__Disclaimer:__ This is a work in progress. In this first version, I'm not gonna implement all the API calls, only the necessary ones to interact with imgur and be able to create albums, upload images and share them on the site.
